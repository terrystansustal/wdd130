                <div>Over the past year, Stan Liner has been participating
                    in charity events. With hundreds of donations to natural disasters,
                    hospitals, and organizations for children, Stan Liner is setting a goal
                    to have a Christmas Toy Drive to give back to children who are less fortunate.
                    This will be held on December 19, 2022.

                <div>During 2019, we strictly required our passengers to wear a mask
                    for their own and other people's safety due to Covid-19. We are happy
                    to announce that we are no longer requiring passengers on wearing a mask.
                    Wearing a mask is now voluntarily.

            <p>Many passengers from Naic, Cavite Philippines need public transportation in order
                to get to work in Manila. Manila is about an hour away from Naic and there are no trains
                available. Buses are the only option for people who doesn't own a private vechicle. Stan Liner's
                bus route is from Ternate, Cavite to PITX, Pasay. This is the only fast and safest bus route for passengers
                from Cavite if they want to go to Manila.
