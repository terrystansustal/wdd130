        <h2>Early days</h2>
        <p>Stan Liner was founded by Augusto T. Abella and Susan N. Sustal back in the 1980's.
            At first the company's name was called Jhepoy when the units were only Baby Buses.
            Augusto drove the baby buses during the early days of the company. The buses back then
            weren't air conditioned and very small. Approximately, the bus can only fit
            20 passengers.

        <h2>Story of Success</h2>
        <p>Throughout the years, Augusto and Susan worked really hard to maintain the growth of
            the company. Both of them were diligent. Eventually, they invested on buying new buses
            to expand their business. Augusto and Susan bought multiple buses that's airconditioned
            that can fit 60 passengers. These buses traveled from Cavite to Manila. In addition,
            other companies rented the bus for their trips. With countless of passengers and
            the growth of networking, Stan Liner became a well-known bus company in Cavite.
