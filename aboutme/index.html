    <h2>Terry</h2>

    <p>Hi everyone! My name is Terrystan Sustal but people calls me Terry for short. I'm 23 years old and I'm from San Francisco, California.
       I served in the Philippines Cebu Mission. I'm currently a full-time student but I'm working hard to get my first certificate to hopefully
       land a job or internship for a tech company.</p>

    <p>Back in my youth I played a lot of basketball. I played for my middle school, high school, and AAU team when I was a teenager.
        When I was about to graduate from high school, I discovered that I also have a passion for filmmaking and photography. Before going on a mission
        I filmed music and wedding videos.</p>

    <p>Lastly, I've been a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ever since I was born. One thing I love about the
        church is General Conference and devotionals because we get to hear from our prophets, apostles, and leaders of the church.</p>
